<p>Devops has been this buzz word that everyone is talking about these days, I have been thinking about reading and studying Devops since the beginning of this year but I did not have enough time and when I stumbled upon this course on Oodi, I decided to take the course right away without hesitation, because through this course I did what I have been wanting to do for month but being lazy instead. Since I took this course my thinking that devOps is a very difficult or hard field has gone away, as I saw myself that devops is very easy and handy thing to learn in the software development industry and that It made the software production process way much faster and more productive and very easy as well. I have to admit this course had tougt me a lot and gave me a chance to explore this field and hopefully one day implement what I learnt in a real life company. Thank you.
Starting from now On I will try to stregthen the knowledge that I acquired during the course and improve it by reading more about DevOps and maybe complete the online O&rsquo;really course and use the new knowledge in my personal project whenever I can apply it, also one thing that I learnt from this course the fact that github provides a free hosting for pages for student accounts, which made me think that I should start working on my online portfolio which will be nice and useful for me to get a job later, again Thank you for this course it was a pleasure being part of it.</p>
