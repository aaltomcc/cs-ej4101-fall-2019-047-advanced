<h1 id="learning-047">Learning 047</h1>

<p>The learning in this course was fun, it was not very challenging, the videos that was presented through the oreilly course was easily digestible and not very difficult, I learnt from it the concept of DevOps, continuous delivery continuous deployment and integration, I got a chance to explore and compare the old apporch of software development and the new approch using DevOps, and how DevOps removes the huge time gape between the development and the deployment and provide very fast results and product for the customer which probably makes more moeny for software companies. For me the most challenging thing was the A plus question specially the question with multiple correct answers that can be chosen, it has been always a pain in the back for me because sometime there arae tricky part that I do not see despite the fact that I watched all the videos twice and googled some concepts while answering the questions   and then when I submit it is wrong and lose points which very disappointing. but anyways this course was a very nice course that makes me more comfortable with DevOps and not intimidated by the concept and also I got a chance to explore Hugo, and Travis with github and github pages which were all new to me.
Finally I would like to Thank you again for putting the time and the effort in this course and looking forward to more courses like this where we can learn new concepts that are currently a trend or buzz words in the technical field.</p>
